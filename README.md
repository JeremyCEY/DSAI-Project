# A137 Team 4 - _Uncover the secrets of sleep_

## About
This is a mini-project on Data Science for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on sleep efficiency. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/eda.ipynb)
3. [Principle Component Analysis](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/pca.ipynb)
4. [Lasso Regression](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/lasso-regression.ipynb)
5. [Multivariate Linear Regression](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/multivariate-regression.ipynb)
6. [Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/random-forest-regression.ipynb)
7. [Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/gradient-boosting.ipynb)

## Objective
Our team's objective is to understand how sleep is affected by a person's lifestyle choices and find out how to improve sleep quality. By inputting your lifestyle choices, we can predict your numeric sleep quality.

## Dataset
Our [Sleep Efficiency dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency) is extracted from Kaggle, which was collected as part of a  study conducted in UK by a research team from the University of Oxfordshire.

## Models used
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Extreme Gradient Boosting
