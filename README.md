# _Uncover the secrets of sleep_

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on sleep efficiency from [Sleep Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

2. [eda](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/eda.ipynb)
3. [pca](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/pca.ipynb)
4. [multivariate-regression](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/multivariate-regression.ipynb)
5. [random-forest-regression](https://github.com/McSpicyWifBacon/DSAI-Project/blob/main/random-forest-regression.ipynb)

## Objective
Our team's objective is to understand how sleep is affected by a person's lifestyle choices and find out how to improve sleep quality. By inputting your lifestyle choices, we can predict your sleep quality.
